<h1>Step 3: Angular</h1>

<p>
  We now have a simple recipe card, but for now it is static <br />
  Start using Angular to pass the data (the recipe) to your HTML template
</p>

<div class="recipe">
  <img class="recipe__picture" [src]="recipe.picture" />
  <h3>
    {{ recipe.title }}
  </h3>
</div>
