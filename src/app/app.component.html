<h1>Step 5: Add an Angular service</h1>

<p>
  Most of the time, components shouldn't display mock data, but should have a
  service provide the data to them instead <br />
  A new folder "services" has appeared in the source code ; in it you will see a
  service named RecipesService. For the sake of brevity, this service has
  already been added to the app correctly. <br /><br />
  Use the RecipesService to fetch the list of recipes, as if it was fetched from
  an API, and bind the result to the template the same way you did in the
  previous tasks. <br /><br />
  To simulate a result from an API, you will use the of() method from RxJs
</p>

<div class="recipes">
  <recipe-card *ngFor="let recipe of recipes" [recipe]="recipe"></recipe-card>
</div>
