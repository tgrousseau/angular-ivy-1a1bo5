<h1>Step 6: Play around with rxjs</h1>

<p>
  Rxjs is a very useful library, and if you want to manipulate the data from
  your API, you will use it. In fact, you probably have noticed that you have
  already used it in the precedent step, as <i>Observable</i> and <i>of</i> are
  part of rxjs.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Task 1:</b> Look at the method recipeSubscribe at line 27 of the
  app.component.ts. This function has a console.log() at the end. Without
  calling the method, can you say what will be printed in the console and why ?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  We now have 3 sets of 2 recipes instead of a list of 6 recipes. You can swap
  sets of recipes with the button below. This will change the value in the
  Observable recipes$ from the recipesService, in order to simulate an
  observable having multiple values
</p>
<p><b>Task 2:</b> Ignore every change of recipes sets after the 2nd change</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Task 3:</b> for each recipes set, remove the second recipe from the set
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <b>Task 4:</b> filter the result for recipes$ to display only the sets where
  at least one recipe has a "s" in its title
</p>

<button (click)="swapRecipes()">Swap recipes sets !</button>

<h1>Set nÂ°{{ recipesService.index + 1 }}:</h1>

<div class="recipes">
  <recipe-card *ngFor="let recipe of recipes" [recipe]="recipe"></recipe-card>
</div>
